# Refund eligibility decision tree

- Verify the subscription tier and billing term. Enterprise annual contracts require finance approval.
- If the incident is tagged as "platform outage", issue a full credit prorated for downtime.
- For shipping or activation delays, offer expedited onboarding plus a 20% credit if the customer is GOLD or higher.
- Always document the root cause category and attach supporting telemetry to the refund record.
- Escalate to the duty manager if the requested credit exceeds $5,000 USD.
