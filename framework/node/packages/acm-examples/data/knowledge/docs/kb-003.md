# Stabilizing API latency regressions

Monitoring detected elevated p95 latency across the public REST API. Follow this checklist:

1. Inspect deployment history for the impacted service and roll back if a canary exceeded SLOs.
2. Flush regional CDN caches and confirm cache hit ratios rebound above 92%.
3. Capture thread dumps from the application nodes to identify blocking calls.
4. Increase autoscaling floor by two nodes per region while the investigation runs.
5. Post an update to the status page every 30 minutes until latency returns under 250 ms.
