# Resetting MFA-secured passwords

1. Validate the caller using two account identifiers and the last successful login timestamp.
2. Confirm MFA enrollment method (TOTP, push, hardware key) and whether the customer still has access.
3. If hardware key is lost, create a temporary bypass token valid for 10 minutes and log the issuance in the security ledger.
4. Require the customer to set a new password that meets the 14-character complexity policy.
5. Close the case by attaching the bypass confirmation ID and notifying the security operations channel.
