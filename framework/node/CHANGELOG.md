# Changelog

All notable changes to the ACM Node.js Framework will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-06

### Added

- Phase 4 completion for Node: Nucleus contract available across planner/runtime; structured planner tool-call envelopes; expanded replay bundles with Nucleus inferences and policy transcripts.
- `@acm/framework` orchestration helper wiring nucleus, planner, runtime, and adapters with a single API.

### Changed

- Docs updated to reflect Nucleus availability in Node v0.5.0 and remove "in progress" phrasing.

### Known Issues / Roadmap

- CLI consolidation (`@acm/cli`) is planned; use package-specific CLIs for now.
- Adapter resumability: LangGraph/MSAF checkpoint/resume path emits warnings; improvements targeted in the next release.
- Ledger enrichment: Additional audit fields (phase/decision for Nucleus inferences, full LLM params, canonical digests) are planned enhancements; current behavior is functional and will be extended without breaking changes.

### Features

- **ACM v0.5 Compliance**: Full specification implementation
  - Context lifecycle with content-addressable refs
  - Plan alternatives (Plan-A and Plan-B)
  - Deterministic guard evaluation
  - Task contracts (idempotency, retry, verification)
  - Policy enforcement hooks
  - Memory ledger for decision tracking
  - Streaming for real-time feedback

- **Developer Experience**
  - Code-first approach (no YAML/JSON authoring)
  - Simple, intuitive APIs
  - Working examples out of the box
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - Easy to extend and customize

- **LLM Integration**
  - Works with local LLM providers (Ollama, vLLM)
  - Streaming token generation
  - Safe fallback when parsing fails
