title: Contributing to ACM
---

We welcome contributions across documentation, SDKs, runtime adapters, and examples. This section outlines expectations for proposals, reviews, and release integration.

## Contribution workflow

1. **Discuss** — open a GitHub issue or join the community forum to describe the change.
2. **Design** — for non-trivial changes, attach a short design doc and reference impacted packages.
3. **Implement** — follow package-specific guidelines (linting, tests, examples).
4. **Review** — request reviewers from the maintainers list; address feedback promptly.
5. **Release** — update changelogs, docs, and bump versions as needed.

## Ground rules

- All contributions must align with the ACM specification `v0.5.0`.
- No direct commits to `main`; use feature branches and pull requests.
- Sign commits if your organization requires provenance.
- Keep API or schema changes accompanied by doc updates and release notes.

## Code of conduct

By contributing you agree to abide by the [DDSE Foundation Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ddse-foundation/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Be respectful, assume good intent, and focus on constructive feedback.

## How to get help

- Create a discussion thread under `Q&A`.
- Tag `@ddse-foundation/acm-maintainers` in blocking GitHub issues.
- Attend monthly office hours announced in the community calendar.
